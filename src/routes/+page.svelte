		<h2 class="h3 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto">I have qualified to race the World Champs twice, and with generous support, I was able to take up the opportunities and realize my dreams! Have a look at the results in the menu for details.</h2>

I aim to inspire everyone who follows my journey and supports me, but, I especially want to inspire my son Enzo.</h2>
