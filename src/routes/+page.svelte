		<h2 class="h3 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto p-2">Through many years of dedication and hard work I have the unique achievement of being the first black African man to ever stand on an Ironman podium!</h2>
		<h2 class="h3 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto p-2">I have qualified to race the World Champs twice, and with generous support, I was able to take up the opportunities and realize my dreams! Have a look at the results in the menu for details.</h2>
		<h2 class="h3 text-center max-w-4xl mx-auto p-2">I promote the "Breaking Limits" tagline as, personally, I have already broken through so many limits that have been placed on me...and I have big goals to break through many more. I aim to inspire everyone who follows my journey and supports me, but, I especially want to inspire my son Enzo.</h2>
